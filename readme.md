# Bomber Defense Game

This project contains a fast-paced 2D shooting game where you control a bomber turret to defend against incoming fighters, as well as the original interactive data analytical dashboards.

## How to Play the Game

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Game**:
    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```

3.  **Controls**:
    *   **Aim**: Move the mouse.
    *   **Shoot**: Left mouse click.
    *   **Restart**: Press 'R' when Game Over.

4.  **Objective**:
    Shoot down as many incoming fighters as possible before they reach your bomber. The game gets harder as your score increases!

## Original Dashboards

The original analytical dashboards are still available:

*   **Dash App**: `python bomber_aim_5.py`
